# Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Objective
The objective of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations before applying machine learning models.

---

##  Dataset
Titanic Dataset (public dataset)

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

##  Steps Performed

1. Data Inspection  
   - Checked dataset structure using `.info()`  
   - Generated summary statistics using `.describe()`  

2. Data Visualization  
   - Created histograms to analyze feature distribution  
   - Used boxplots to detect outliers  
   - Generated correlation heatmap  
   - Created pairplots to understand feature relationships  

3. Pattern & Insight Identification  
   - Observed distribution trends  
   - Identified skewness in numerical features  
   - Analyzed correlation between variables  
   - Highlighted potential anomalies  

---

##  Key Observations

- Fare feature shows right-skewed distribution.
- Higher fare passengers had better survival probability.
- Some numerical features contain outliers.
- Certain features show moderate correlation.

##  Conclusion

EDA helped in understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. This step is crucial before building any machine learning model to ensure better performance and reliability.
